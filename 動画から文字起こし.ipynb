      "So how would you advise us to prepare and and I guess what would you tell our generation we feel scarred from the crisis? Yeah first of all, I think One of the problems is that the experience that you had as the last experience is the one that's going to stick in your mind And probably will not be the one that's going to get you so that the next experience will be very very different I know my my parents went through the Great Depression and then they missed out on the boom Because then they're always thinking about that And so I think I think that what they need to do is see all of those crises That's why you can see inflationary ones and see all of those and once you get that perspective I would say three things to your generation. Okay, three recommendations The first recommendation is to is to think about your savings and how much money do you have for savings and the best way to Think about that is to think how much money do I spend each month and how much money do I have saved? so that I can how many months am I going to be okay without that and to value savings right and Calculate it because savings in that is freedom and security and think about what that is So that's that's the first what how much do I have for that? The second thing is how do I? Save well, what should I put my saving in and when thinking about what you should put your saving in? Realize that the least risk investment that you think from volatility is the least risk investment which is cash is the worst investment over a period of time and You could judge that by judging the rate of inflation in relationship to the after-tax income you're going to earn So if you have an inflation rate That's two or three percent and you're earning one percent and you have to pay taxes on that one percent or the one or two Percent that you're going to get you're going to get taxed Essentially at two percent a year and that's going to be a problem. So you have to move into assets that are Other assets that are going to do better over a period of time and When you do that, the most important thing I can convey to you is to diversify Well, because I can guarantee you that one of those assets and you won't be able to pick the right one Will be disastrous in your lifetime that you will lose half of that savings if you're in the wrong one And you won't know what the right one is and so pick different countries pick different Asset classes and I could probably take too long explaining how you might do that But but so that would be the the second thing to learn First thing is think about how to save be cautious about debt when you're thinking about debt Think about is that debt going to help my savings or is it going to produce an income? Sometimes debt like buying a house or buying an apartment or buying an asset it produces forced savings Forced savings is a good thing or if you're taking on debt and you're thinking am I going to have that debt in an asset? That asset better produce more income than the asset than the cost of your debt If you're using debt for consumption, that's not a good thing to do. Okay, you're giving up that that safety So I want so number one is Think about how much you save and think about whether that should be it and what how you borrow number two Make sure that you think about the diversification of that not in cash and number three Do the opposite of what your instincts are if you're going to play the game? It has to be the opposite of what your instincts in the crowd says because the market reflects the crowd. So You want to buy when no one wants to buy and you want to sell when no one wants to sell, right? So and that's emotionally difficult And probably you're not going to play that game Well, because it takes a lot of resources to play the good I'm we spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to try to play that game Well, and it's a tough game to play. Well, so I would caution you about the market timing game But I would say that if you're going to do it do it in the ways that are uncomfortable because they're opposite your instincts\n",
